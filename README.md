# my-react-boilerplate

Basic and extensible boilerplate for developing single-page React applications. Utilizes a small number of essential webapp dependencies such as Webpack and Babel.

Development mode uses [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) which serves the bundle from memory and watches for changes.

### npm commands

`npm run dev` to serve the app in development mode to localhost:9000  
`npm run build` to build the app for production
